# Typescript Google Maps

Had to write another Google Maps Component and thought about
writing an "base" one and share it with the community.

## Getting Started

To install this project
```
git clone git@github.com:DominikAngerer/typescript-google-maps.git typescript-google-maps
```

Now run:
```
npm install
```

## Run the server
```
gulp
```

## Build
To build, run
```
gulp build
```
If you add the `--production` flag all your js, css, html files get minified/uglified:
```
gulp build --production
```
